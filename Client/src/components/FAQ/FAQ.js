          What is a carbon footprint, and why is it important to calculate it?
        </h3>
        <p class="para3">
          A carbon footprint measures the total amount of greenhouse gases,
          particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted directly or indirectly by
          human activities. It's crucial to calculate it because understanding
          our carbon footprint helps us identify areas where we can reduce
          emissions and make more sustainable choices.

        <h3 class="heading2">What are carbon offsets, and how do they work?</h3>
        <p class="para3">
          Carbon offsets are investments in projects that reduce or remove
          greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere, such as reforestation
          initiatives, renewable energy projects, and methane capture programs.
          By purchasing carbon offsets, individuals and businesses can balance
          out their own carbon emissions and support sustainability efforts
          globally.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading2">
